# Quantum-Searching-in-Database
A quantum search that can search for a value or element in an unsorted set in O(√N) as opposed to classical search algorithms that at worse will find an element in O(N) time.

Besides searching for an element, Grover’s algorithm can be used for inverting a function and solving the collision problem. Given an unordered set of N = 2n states X = {x1, x2, …, xN } and a binary function f : {0, 1} the algorithm will find a state x ′ such that f(x ′ ) = 1.
